What I've created is a order list for a coffee shop. Customers are able to create an account and submit their coffee orders. Once the order is submitted the employees are able to look into their point of sale and see what orders need to be fulfilled. Once the order is complete they are able to hit the completed (red check-mark) button and remove the order from their list.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB

How I built this project is using HTML and CSS for markup text and styling. I used Javascript for the logic of the project. For example I used Javascript to have the ability to sumbit a form of a customer's desired order. Once they've filled out the selected options it is printed into the order section. Once the order is fulfilled there is a completed button to click on to show that the order is completed. I also used Javascript to be able to delete items and make edits in case a mistake was made. In the back-end I used MongoDB to store any data I submitted to my database. Express was used to simplify the process of creating my database to store information. I was passionate about this project because I enjoy a cup of coffee and wanted to create a project that was relative to my life. 

LESSON LEARNED:

The lesson I learned is the process of using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to save information to my database. I learned more about Javascript and how powerful it is in the client and server side. I am excited to create more projects!
